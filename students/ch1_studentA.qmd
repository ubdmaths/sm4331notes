# Random Sampling

When experimenting, the data collected can be represented or modeled as a set of **random variables** that describe the observed values.

We can model this by assuming $X = {X_1,\dots, X_n}$ sampled from a population whose pdf or pmf is $f_x(x)$

We can write this as $${X_1,\dots, X_n} \sim f_x(x)$$

::: {#nte-sampling}
Key Assumption ðŸ“Œ: The distribution $f_x$ is imposed on data as a model.
:::

## Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) Samples

The samples are assumed to be:

-   Independent: No relationship between observations.
-   Identical Distribution: Each sample follows the same probability distribution.

As a result, the **joint probability density function (pdf)** can be written as:

$$ f_X(X_1, \dots, X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} f(X_i) $$

# Definition 1 (Statistics)

A statistic is any function :::

Let $$
X_1, \dots, X_n \sim \text{N}(\mu, \sigma^2).
$$ What is the distribution of the sum of squares?
